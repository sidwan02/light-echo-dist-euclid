# light-echo-dist-euclid

# 

This project serves as the precursor to my Project on [schwarzschild-ray-tracing](https://github.com/sidwan02/schwarzschild-ray-tracing/). In this project, I model the incidence of light emitted close to a source, here, the AGN 
or Blackhole.
The user may change the position of the BLC or Broad Line Cloud which is incident to this light, and may view the distribution of light-delays that reprocess before travelling 
to the user on Earth at infinity.
